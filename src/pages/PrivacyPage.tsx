              <h2>What Data We Collect</h2>
              <p>
                <strong>We collect minimal personal data.</strong> Iris runs on your
                device and connects to decentralized networks. We don't track your
                activity, collect analytics, or store your posts on our servers.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Iris usernames (iris.to/username):</strong> If you register a
                username, we log your public key, username, registration IP address, and
                country. This data is necessary to prevent abuse and maintain the username
                service.
              </p>

              <h2>Your Data is Local</h2>
              <p>
                Everything is stored on your device: your keys, ecash tokens, settings,
                and cached content. You're responsible for securing your device and
                backing up your data. If you lose your device or clear storage, your data
                may be permanently lost.
              </p>

              <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
              <p>Iris connects you to decentralized services we don't control:</p>
              <p>
                <strong>Nostr relays</strong> may log your IP address and store the posts
                you publish publicly. Content posted to Nostr is public and permanent.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Cashu mints</strong> may log your IP and track ecash transactions.
                We don't operate any mints.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>File hosts</strong> may log uploads. Files you upload may be
                publicly accessible.
              </p>

              <h2>Your Control</h2>
              <p>
                You control your data. Delete it by clearing storage or uninstalling the
                app. Choose which relays and mints to use in settings. Export your data
                anytime.
              </p>
